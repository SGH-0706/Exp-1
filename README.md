# SRS (Procedure):
1. Customer Self-Service and Account Access Procedure This is the primary customer interaction
flow, focused on account management and transactions:

WITHDRAW cash.
DEPOSIT funds.
FUND TRANSFER between accounts (mediated by the ATM).
Change their PIN (mediated by the ATM).
New Services: The Customer can also apply for new services:
